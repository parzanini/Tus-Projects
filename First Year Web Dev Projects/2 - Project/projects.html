                <p class="project_description">I created a simple website about my home city, Sao Paulo, that highlights
                    some of the most popular
                    landmarks and
                    attractions. The website features a homepage with a brief introduction to the city and its history,
                    followed by a
                    section that showcases famous landmarks such as the SÃ£o Paulo Museum of Art, the Municipal Market,
                    and Ibirapuera Park.</p>

                <p class="project_description">The Tic Tac Toe app I created is a simple yet entertaining game that can
                    be played on any device
                    running Java. The app
                    features a user-friendly interface that allows players to choose their symbols (either X or O) and
                    compete against one
                    another. The game board is displayed on the screen, and players can take turns placing their symbols
                    on the board until
                    one player wins or the game ends in a draw.</p>

                <!-- Copywrite free Image, source: Screenshot from my computer running the application -->
                <p class="project_description">I created a web-based quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz
                    consists of multiple-choice
                    questions and the user can select only one option. The questions and answers are stored in an array,
                    and the score is
                    calculated automatically based on the user's responses. At the end of the quiz, the user can see
                    their final score and
                    review the correct answers. The design of the quiz is user-friendly, making it easy for
                    anyone to use.</p>

                <p class="project_description">I created a simple to-do list application using Java. With this app,
                    users can add, edit, and delete
                    tasks that they
                    need to complete. The application provides a user-friendly interface with options to mark tasks as
                    completed or to set a
                    due date for each task. The to-do list is saved locally and can be accessed anytime. This
                    application is perfect for
                    anyone looking to organize their daily tasks and stay on top of their responsibilities.</p>
